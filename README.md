A locally run bot that allows you track up to (unknown number) subreddits or search queries on Reddit. The bot will messages in a specified channel for any new post detected corresponding to the search query or subreddit. This is useful for people who are looking for good deals on subreddits like /r/hardwareswap or /r/buildapcsales and want to be the first to catch hot prices.

Written in JavaScript. Uses snoowrap API wrapper for Reddit.
